Ta-da, here's your go-to Python learning repository!

During the last tech session, I was asked to share some projects that others could learn from. To help, I decided to create a repository to share my knowledge.

**The first project is TSM: Task Manager**  
This provides a great opportunity to learn OOP, the `@property` decorator, and testing with the Slash library.
```
pip install slash
slash run .\tests\test_tsm.py
```

If you're interested in testing, feel free to add more cases! There's still plenty more to cover if you're looking to dive deeper.


Please let me know if you find any issues!!
