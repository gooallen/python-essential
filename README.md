Ta-da, here's your go-to Python learning repository!

During the last tech session, I was asked to share some projects that others could learn from.  
To help, I decided to create a repository to share my knowledge.

**The first project is TSM: Task Manager**  
This provides a great opportunity to learn OOP, the `@property` decorator, and testing with the Slash library.
